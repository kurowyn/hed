# hed
A terminal editor, named hed (as in Horrible Editor), in the Python programing language.

# How to use
Given a file argument, the program shows the entire contents of that file.

While the file is being shown, you can enter one of several options to interact with the file:

__u__: go up a line

__d__: go down a line

__x__: exit

You can precede each of these commands by a single digit positive integer _n_ in order to repeat them an _n_ number of times.

Pressing space invokes the previous command, so that if you used _u_ beforehand, and then press space afterwards, you'll keep on going up the file.

More improvements coming soon.
